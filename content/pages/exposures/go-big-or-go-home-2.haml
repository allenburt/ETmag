      %p What do you get when you cross adrenaline-seeking junkies with rickety, unreliable vehicles in the extreme landscape conditions of South America?<br><br>ANSWER: The Mototaxi Junket, a down-and-dirty, cross-country race that runs from Asuncion, Paraguay, to Cusco, Peru, aboard a mototaxi, a customized motorbike of sorts with

    .first.textborder three wheels and an uncomfortable sofa on the back, all covered by a ramshackle shade.  When you’ve hiked the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, traversed the mountains in Bolivia, kayaked the deep lakes of Patagonia and cycled through the Andes, there’s still one adventure left in South America that you probably haven’t encountered, and that’s the Mototaxi Junket.<br><br>In 2011, the Mototaxi Junket will celebrate its third year of bruises, bumps and scrapes, but the creators of the event aren’t strangers to adrenaline-junkie adventures. You may be more familiar with the Adventurists’ other races, which include the Mongol Rally, a multi-week race from England to Mongolia, and the Rickshaw Run, which crosses India.  Like these other races, the Mototaxi Junket has a starting point and ending point (about 2,485 miles apart), but the route between the two is completely up to the teams, which are each made of one to three people.
    .second.textborder  On this race, participants must traverse the unforgiving terrain of South America—sand dunes, dirt tracks, deep mud, salt flats and, of course, the Andes—all in a vehicle that is meant to take people short distances on the back streets of small towns. But it’s all for a good purpose: Each Adventurist race raises money for a charity, which benefits the local community. The chosen charity for 2011 is Practical Action.<br><br>All that said, don’t sweat the “race” part too much. The goal here is simply to finish … and have fun.  No Adventurist race comes without its costs, though. Lest the adrenaline bug inside of you be lured by the race, you should know that participating is at your own risk. People are seriously injured and occasionally die when participating in Adventurist events.<br><br>Ready to get started?
